# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.

 The website will be static and simple - largely plaintext with links to our social media and collab form being most important.The site is intended to be the starting point for those interested in joining C@C - and those who want to learn more or are looking to collab, the simple website will make it easy to navigate to these desired destinations. The site will be designed for mobile as that is what most users are expected. It is intended that the audience will have their goals addressed quickly on this website, or more thorughouly in subsequent pages such as social media or the collab form.

- C@C logo is the most important - branding is paramount

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

Iteration 1:

![](iteration_1.jpg)
The first iteration, I organized marjority of the content onto its own page. This made for many short pages.

Iteration 2:
![](iteration_2.jpg)
The second time, I merged some of the content to the same page to make for simpler navigation and fewer pages.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

I will be using iteration 2. I believe this will provide a more concise and navigable website for users. The content continues to target students and individuals interested in our club. It's content is helpful for current and prospective members to keep track of what the club is up to, to learn more about the club, and how to join or organize a collab.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

1. homepage
2. About page
3. Events page

The homepage will contain the pertientn links as well as a quick blurb about the club. Those who want to learn more *about* the club can go to the about page to learn about its founding, its eboard, and more. The events page will house past and future events, and pictures from the events. This simple layout allows for users to know exactly what they are getting into and be able to easily retrieve the information they are looking for.
